    <h2>Jhay Krant</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone. I'm Jonathan Nkansah Koranteng but most of my 
        friends refer to me as Jhay Krant. I come from and live 
        in Accra, Ghana. I'm currently a student nurse but because I 
        love technology as well, I decided to take some 
        classes with BYUI online and it been great so far.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church all my life because I was born into it.
        I served my mission in Lagos, Nigeria and it was an amazing experience.
         I'm currently not married. On my leisure time, I practice the piano
        because I also live music a lot, and I help out with choir practice
        in my ward and stake.</p>
    <p>The online degree I chose was software development and I believe that the skills
        I will obtain will help me create amazing projects for myself and for others.
        I look forward to learning from everyone. Nice to meet you all.
    </p>
